<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
 
Problem Statement: My dad is an avid beer fan , and also likes to get the best deals on beer. So he will go to different stores to check on the beer prices and get the cheapest ones.

Seeing this, i realise how i could let him do the same price comparision from the comfort of his own home.

Price Checker uses WebScrapping to gather the data of all Wine,Beers and Spirits on grocery stores online platform.
I then automate the process of recording and displaying the data on a CSV file.
webscrapping requires a firm understanding of HTML and CSS , understanding selectors(classes , ID) and the different HTML Tags to retrieve specific information.

## Reflection
Webscrapping on a small scale like this can help to automate simple task and present data. 
Through this mini-project i can see the potential webscrapping can provide to large companies, for example through webscraping companies can identify the price points their competitors are offering the same services. 
This can automate the process of data collection and with python it makes data manipulation that much more easier.

I hope to be able to delve deeper into web scraping and python and continue to improve and build more projects.
